# AI Cognitive Framework V5.0 - Multi-Modal Reasoning & Control

**AI Cognitive Framework V5.0** is a production-ready cognitive architecture designed for complex reasoning, multi-modal processing, and autonomous executive control.

## Key Components

- **Executive Control Hub**: Manages dynamic resource allocation and prioritizes cognitive tasks.
- **Intuition Engine**: Advanced pattern matching and similarity-based reasoning calibration.
- **Thought Persona Engine**: Dynamically adapts reasoning styles based on task context.
- **Temporal Memory Layer**: Maintains awareness of temporal sequences and long-term implications.
- **Recursive Logic Protection**: Safeguards against infinite reasoning loops and circular dependencies.

## Usage

```python
import asyncio
from asi_v5_production import AdvancedExecutiveControlHub, UltimateMultiModalInput

async def main():
    hub = AdvancedExecutiveControlHub()
    # ... usage logic
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- Standard library modules (`asyncio`, `logging`, `dataclasses`, `collections`, etc.)
